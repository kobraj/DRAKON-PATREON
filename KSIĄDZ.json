  "description": "I used a cheat to create a character in the game. When I came to my senses after pressing the play button, I had possessed the “Priest of Corruption” character I had created. It had to be a character who had bad stats and was hated by all! All I had on me is a woman’s dried up hand, but that hand was a goddess’s?!",
